# Introduction

This is intended to be a node.js implementation of the uavtalk protocol.

This is heavily copied from the node-uavtalk-proxy library from grantmd.  https://github.com/grantmd/node-uavtalk-proxy

The goal of this is to be able to control a flight controller over the uavtalk protocol.  My particular use case uses a Raspberry PI riding on the back of a quadcopter running the cc3d flight controller.
